## Triggering Test Push Notifications

### New Event Announcement

In the Classic Admin UI, there is a button for triggering a test event announcement. This will send an email to yourself,
and send a push notification for your push notification token.

To access the UI, you will need at least the `admin` role. Visit `/admin` on the group website, and log in. From there,
go to the Events tab and click "Details" on an event. From there, you should see a yellow "Test Announcement" button.
Press that button, and the email and push notification should follow.

### Group Membership Announcement

### New Message Notification

You will need two accounts to test this. See "Creating a new member account" below.

Let's say you're logged into the app as User A. On the website, log in as User B. Then,
send a message to user A. This sends a push notification to you, logged in to the app as User A.

### Event Comment

You will need two accounts to test this. See "Creating a new member account" below.

Let's say you're logged into the app as User A. As User A, RSVP to an event.
Then, log in as User B on the website. Look up an event, and post a comment. You should
receive a push notification as User A on the app.

### "Last Chance" Event Reminder

### Reminder of an upcoming event you are attending

### Notification of new RSVPs to your event

### Creating a new member account

A new account can be created if you have the `members` permission role.
Go to the "Members (New)" navigation link found on the home page of the group's website, in the left-side navigation,
in the "Admin" section. On the next page, click the "New Member" button to access the form for creating a new member account.
